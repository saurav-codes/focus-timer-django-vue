# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current calendar integration requires users to connect their Google Calendar before they can use any calendar functionality, including basic task scheduling. This creates a barrier for users who want to use the calendar feature for task management without connecting external services. This feature will make Google Calendar integration optional while preserving all existing functionality for connected users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who doesn't want to connect Google Calendar, I want to use the calendar sidebar to schedule my tasks, so that I can manage my time without external integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the calendar sidebar without Google Calendar connected THEN the system SHALL display a functional FullCalendar component
2. WHEN a user drags a task to the calendar sidebar without Google Calendar connected THEN the system SHALL allow the task to be scheduled successfully
3. WHEN a user views the calendar without Google Calendar connected THEN the system SHALL show only local tasks marked as ON_CAL status
4. WHEN a user navigates calendar dates without Google Calendar connected THEN the system SHALL not attempt to fetch Google Calendar events

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to optionally connect my Google Calendar to see external events alongside my tasks, so that I can have a complete view of my schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has not connected Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL display a connect button in the calendar header
2. WHEN a user clicks the connect button THEN the system SHALL initiate the Google OAuth flow
3. WHEN a user successfully connects Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL display both local tasks and Google events
4. WHEN a user has connected Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL show a disconnect button instead of connect button
5. WHEN a user disconnects Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL continue showing local tasks but stop fetching Google events

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user with Google Calendar connected, I want to maintain all existing functionality, so that my current workflow is not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has Google Calendar connected THEN the system SHALL fetch and display Google Calendar events
2. WHEN a user drags or resizes Google Calendar events THEN the system SHALL update the events in Google Calendar
3. WHEN a user clicks on Google Calendar events THEN the system SHALL open the read-only modal with event details
4. WHEN a user navigates calendar dates with Google Calendar connected THEN the system SHALL fetch events for the new date range

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to efficiently handle requests based on user's connection status, so that we don't waste resources on unnecessary API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user without Google Calendar connection makes calendar requests THEN the backend SHALL not attempt Google Calendar API calls
2. WHEN the WebSocket consumer receives requests from unconnected users THEN the system SHALL return empty Google events array
3. WHEN the system checks connection status THEN it SHALL use the GoogleCalendarCredentials model to determine connectivity
4. WHEN a user disconnects Google Calendar THEN the system SHALL clean up WebSocket connections and stop polling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual indicators of my Google Calendar connection status, so that I understand what functionality is available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Google Calendar is not connected THEN the system SHALL show a connect icon/button in the calendar header
2. WHEN Google Calendar is connected THEN the system SHALL show a disconnect icon/button in the calendar header
3. WHEN Google Calendar connection fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN the system is loading Google Calendar data THEN it SHALL show loading indicators
