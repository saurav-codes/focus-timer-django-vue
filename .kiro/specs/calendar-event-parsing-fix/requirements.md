# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ReadOnlyModal.vue component in the calendar integration has multiple date parsing issues that result in "Invalid date" being displayed for event times and other date-related fields. The component needs robust date parsing logic that can handle various date formats from different calendar sources (Google Calendar, FullCalendar, etc.) and gracefully handle edge cases. It also needs to properly parse and display other fields like attendees, their status, and many other event details. The goal is to properly display as much information as possible while keeping the code simple enough for beginner developers to understand.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user viewing calendar event details, I want to see properly formatted start and end times instead of "Invalid date", so that I can understand when events are scheduled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal displays an event with valid dateTime fields THEN the start and end times SHALL be formatted correctly as readable dates
2. WHEN the modal displays an all-day event with date fields THEN the dates SHALL be formatted as full dates without time components
3. WHEN the modal encounters malformed date data THEN it SHALL display a fallback message instead of "Invalid date"
4. WHEN the modal displays recurring events THEN the original start time SHALL be parsed and formatted correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing calendar event details, I want to see accurate event duration and relative time information, so that I can quickly understand the event timing context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal calculates event duration THEN it SHALL handle both timed and all-day events correctly
2. WHEN the modal displays relative time THEN it SHALL show meaningful phrases like "in 2 hours" or "2 days ago"
3. WHEN the modal encounters events with missing end times THEN it SHALL handle the calculation gracefully without errors
4. WHEN the modal displays timezone information THEN it SHALL preserve and display the original timezone data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user viewing calendar event details, I want to see properly formatted creation and modification timestamps, so that I can understand when events were created or last updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal displays event metadata THEN creation and update timestamps SHALL be formatted consistently
2. WHEN the modal encounters RFC3339 timestamp formats THEN it SHALL parse them correctly
3. WHEN the modal displays timestamps THEN it SHALL include both date and time information
4. WHEN timestamp data is missing or invalid THEN the modal SHALL hide those fields instead of showing errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with calendar integrations, I want the date parsing logic to be robust and handle multiple input formats, so that the component works reliably with different calendar sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component receives Google Calendar API event objects THEN it SHALL parse all date fields correctly
2. WHEN the component receives FullCalendar event objects THEN it SHALL handle the different date format structures
3. WHEN the component encounters ISO 8601 date strings THEN it SHALL parse them using the appropriate date-fns functions
4. WHEN the component receives Date objects THEN it SHALL handle them without additional parsing
5. WHEN the component encounters null or undefined date values THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully without throwing errors

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user viewing calendar event details, I want to see properly formatted attendee information including their names and response status, so that I can understand who is invited and their participation status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal displays event attendees THEN it SHALL show attendee names clearly formatted
2. WHEN the modal displays attendee response status THEN it SHALL use meaningful labels like "Accepted", "Declined", "Tentative", "No Response"
3. WHEN the modal encounters attendee data with missing names THEN it SHALL display email addresses as fallback
4. WHEN the modal displays the event organizer THEN it SHALL clearly distinguish them from regular attendees
5. WHEN attendee information is missing or malformed THEN the modal SHALL handle it gracefully without displaying errors

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user viewing calendar event details, I want to see comprehensive event information including location, description, and other metadata, so that I have all the context I need about the event.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal displays event location THEN it SHALL format and display location information clearly
2. WHEN the modal displays event description THEN it SHALL preserve formatting and handle HTML content appropriately
3. WHEN the modal displays event status THEN it SHALL show meaningful status labels like "Confirmed", "Tentative", "Cancelled"
4. WHEN the modal displays event visibility THEN it SHALL indicate privacy levels like "Public", "Private", "Default"
5. WHEN optional event fields are missing THEN the modal SHALL hide those sections instead of showing empty or error states

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user viewing calendar event details, I want consistent date formatting throughout the modal, so that the interface feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal displays multiple date fields THEN they SHALL use consistent formatting patterns
2. WHEN the modal displays dates in different contexts THEN it SHALL use appropriate format styles (full date, relative time, etc.)
3. WHEN the modal displays timezone information THEN it SHALL be clearly indicated and consistently formatted
4. WHEN the modal displays all-day events THEN it SHALL clearly distinguish them from timed events
