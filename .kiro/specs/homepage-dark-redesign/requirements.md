# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves redesigning the existing Tymr Online homepage to implement a modern dark theme design system. The current homepage uses a light theme with soft colors, but we want to transform it into a sleek, professional dark interface that maintains the same content structure while applying the new visual design language. The redesign will focus on visual transformation rather than functional changes, ensuring the existing user experience remains intact while dramatically improving the aesthetic appeal.
